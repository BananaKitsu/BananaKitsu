Hi there! I'm BananaKitsu!
Welcome to my personal project repository! This space is dedicated to exploring and experimenting with the powerful capabilities of Visual Studio Code (VS Code), focusing on HTML and JavaScript development.

As part of this journey, I intend to dive into the world of web development, learning new techniques, and building projects that leverage the flexibility of VS Code. Whether it's simple websites, interactive JavaScript features, or exploring the nuances of web technologies.

In this repository, you'll find:

HTML & JavaScript Projects: From basic web pages to more complex interactive applications.
VS Code Exploration: Tips, configurations, and extensions that improve the development experience with VS Code.
Learning Projects: Ongoing experimentation with new features in HTML, JavaScript, and web APIs.
Feel free to explore the projects, learn from the code, and contribute with suggestions or improvements. This repository is a place to explore, grow, and refine web development skills in a fun and hands-on way!

About me!
I am just an aspiring developer with a passion for web development. The journey here is all about learning, experimenting, and improving skills in the world of front-end technologies. The goal is to build both small and large projects while becoming proficient with the tools that make development easier and more efficient, especially Visual Studio Code.
